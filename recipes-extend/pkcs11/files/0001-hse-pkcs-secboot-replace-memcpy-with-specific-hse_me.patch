Subject: [PATCH] hse: pkcs: secboot: replace memcpy() with specific
 hse_memcpy()

When running hse-secboot command to enable secure boot feature
form user space, there is a "Bus error" reported. The reason is that
multiple bytes is copied into a share memory region that is defined as
device  memory, and their address don't align with even address.
For fixing this issue, NXP creates a specific memory copy function
hse_memcpy() to work around this issue. So, replace memcpy()
with specific hse_memcpy().
